    'description' => 'Programs serve as comprehensive frameworks that unite security standards and controls into cohesive, manageable initiatives within an organization. They represent structured approaches to achieving specific security objectives by combining relevant standards (which define \'what\' needs to be done) with appropriate controls (which specify \'how\' to do it). Each program typically addresses a distinct area of compliance, risk management, or security enhancement, making it easier to track progress, measure effectiveness, and ensure accountability. For example, a Data Privacy Program might incorporate standards from GDPR and CCPA, implementing specific controls like data encryption, access management, and regular audits to meet these requirements. By organizing security measures into programs, organizations can better coordinate their security efforts, allocate resources effectively, and maintain clear oversight of their security posture across different domains and objectives.',
