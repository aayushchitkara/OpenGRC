        A security control is a safeguard or countermeasure designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability of information systems and data. These controls can be physical, technical, or administrative in
        nature. Physical controls include measures like locks and surveillance cameras to secure physical assets.
        Technical controls, often software or hardware-based, include firewalls, encryption, and antivirus programs,
        aimed at protecting digital assets from cyber threats. Administrative controls consist of policies, procedures,
        and training that govern user behavior and operational procedures. Together, these controls form a comprehensive
        defense against a wide range of security threats, from unauthorized access and data breaches to internal policy
        violations. In a world where digital threats are constantly evolving, the implementation and continuous
        refinement of these security controls are crucial for maintaining the overall security posture of an
        organization.
