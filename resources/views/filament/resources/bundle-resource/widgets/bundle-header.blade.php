        Content Bundles make it easy for you to enhance your security and compliance program by importing ready-made
        collections of standards, controls, and other data into your OpenGRC. Whether you’re looking to align with new
        regulations or strengthen your existing framework, simply select the bundle you need and click “Install” to
        bring that content directly into your environment. This helps you stay current with industry best practices,
        reduce manual work, and save time as you build and maintain a robust security posture.
