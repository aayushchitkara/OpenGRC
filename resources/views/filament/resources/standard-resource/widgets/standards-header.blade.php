        Security standards are a set of guidelines and best practices designed to safeguard systems, networks, and data
        from various cyber threats. They establish a baseline for implementing and measuring effective security controls
        within organizations. These standards cover a broad range of areas including network security, data encryption,
        access control, and vulnerability management. By adhering to these standards, organizations can protect
        themselves against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats, thereby ensuring the
        confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their information assets. Common examples of security standards
        include ISO/IEC 27001, which provides a framework for information security management systems, and the Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which outlines security measures for organizations handling
        credit card transactions.
