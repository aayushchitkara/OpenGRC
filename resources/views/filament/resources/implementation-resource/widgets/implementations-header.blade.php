        Implementations are the actual means and methods we use to implement a control. Implementations relate to one or
        many controls and can satisfy the requirements of a control in various ways. For example, a control that
        requires a password to be at least 8 characters long can be implemented by configuring a system to enforce this
        requirement using a specific procedure or technology.
